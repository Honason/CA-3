      <h3>Frontend testing</h3>

      <img src="app/images/frontend-test.png"/>
      <p>We have used Karma combined with Jasmine to create automated testing of our frontend functions. We found that an application of this scale that tests were mostly a waste of time since we could easily test manually. The right time to construct these tests would be right before starting to code the application itself so that we could test our code against the test instead of testing the test against the code. </p>
      <p>There were not a lot of frontend functionality, most importantly was that the calculator converted correctly and the login system handled tokens without fault.</p>

      <p>Tests:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>CVRAPI</strong></li>
        <li>No input in the search query</li>
        <li>Correct data allocation when returned from api</li>

        <li><strong>Login</strong></li>
        <li>Logout button deleting token from browser</li>

        <li><strong>Calculator</strong></li>
        <li>Correctly convert between currencies</li>
        <li>Only show 2 decimals</li>
      </ul>
      

      <h3>Backend Unit testing</h3>

        <p>
          We have also tested our UserFacade. Comments corresponding to methods explain what is going on.

      <h3>Manual API testing</h3>
      <p>
        To simplify the process and save time, we have decided to conduct the simple API testing of register
        functionality in Postman application. We have selected four test cases to ensure that system behaves as it should.
      </p>
      <p>
        Register API path expects json object as a parameter in body, which contains username and password values. In first test,
        we wont set this object. Instead, we will do empty POST request to api register path. Server returns 400 (bad request) error,
        and information about the error.
      </p>
      <img src="app/images/empty_request.png" />
      <p>
        In second test, we will try to send just on of the username-password pair. The server should return the same http 400 status,
        with message "Incomplete request".
      </p>
      <img src="app/images/incomplete_request.png"/>
      <p>
        In third test, we will pass valid object with both username and password, but with username that is already registered.
        Expected result is again status 400, and message "User already exist".
      </p>
      <img src="app/images/user_exist_request.png"/>
      <p>
        The fourth and last test case passes valid object with username and password, with username that doesn't exist in our database.
        Expected response is OK status 200, and same json response object as login path. Username and token.
      </p>
